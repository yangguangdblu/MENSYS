The MENSY(Mutiple Energy System) library is an open-source Modelica library for the dynamic modelling of thermal power plants and energy conversion systems. It provides basic components for system-level modelling, in particular for the study of control systems in combined cooling, heating and power systems.The CHP library is only part of the MENSYS, and we will devolop more parts in future.
